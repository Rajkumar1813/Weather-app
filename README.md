# Weather-app

A weather app which tells the weather of particular locationðŸŒ¦.

This app shows the weather details like Temperature ðŸŒ¡, Humidity ðŸŒ¨, Wind Speed ðŸŒ«, Wind Direction ðŸ§­, Sunrise Time ðŸŒ…, Sunset Time â›…, etc.
By default it shows the weather of "KASHIPUR" but one can search any city name and can get information about that city's weather.

Will bring some more change as soon as possible âœ¨.
My aim is to keep this project simple and understandable so that anyone and everyone could get benifit from it.
